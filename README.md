Data analysis for Instacart using Jupyter notebook in the Anaconda environment.
Analysis performed for learning purposes with CareerFoundry

Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. As a data analyst , using python, I have performed an initial data exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggested strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.This analysis informs to the stakeholders what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.

In this project, Using Python - I learned Data wrangling & Subsetting, Data consistency checks,Combining & Exporting Data ,Deriving new variables,Grouping Data and Aggregation, & Data Visualization.

Data sets used in this project are open-source data sets from Instacart from year 2017 made available online by Instacart.The consumer data and the prices of the products were both fabricated for learning purposes. Some of the datasets contain over 32M observations.

My Python repository contains - Scripts in Jupyter and the Final report in Excel summarizing all the task performed in the project to final insights.

In this project I mainly worked with Jupyter in Anaconda Environment, using Libraries like Pandas, numpy , OS and for few tasks I also used libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy for creating visualizations in Python. 

For Data Exploration I used functions like Head, Tail, Shape, Info and dtypes. Functions like Describe were very useful for exploring Descriptive Statistics. Also I learned how to use lists to ignore unnecessary columns when importing data.In data wrangling process, syntaxes for dropping and renaming columns, changing data types and transposing data were applied, Worked with partial datasets using Subsetting.Later in data preparation, I performed data consistency checks where I found and addressed mixed data type variables, missing and duplicate values. For Combining and merging data for large scale manipulations , I applied fucntions like concat , append, join and merge and then later exported data into pickle format. In order to draw insights, as expected by Instacart stakeholders, further transformation procedures like deriving new columns using if-statements, loc and for-loops functions, as well as grouping and aggregating methods were applied. Finally, for visualizations of my analysis, I used bar charts, horizontally and stacked bar charts, pie charts, line charts, histograms, and scatterplots.
