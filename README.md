Project name : Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. As a data analyst , using python, I have performed an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggested strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.This analysis informs to the stakeholders what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products
